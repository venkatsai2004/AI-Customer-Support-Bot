API Documentation
Our REST API allows developers to integrate with our platform.
Use the base URL https://api.example.com/v1/ for all requests.
Authentication requires an API key in the header.
Rate Limiting
API calls are limited to 1000 requests per hour per API key.
Exceeded limits return a 429 status code. Premium accounts have higher limits.
Error Handling

400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.
Error messages include details in JSON format.
